# IngredientInsightApp

Welcome to the IngredientInsightApp repository, home to my Final Year Project. This application is a cutting-edge skincare ingredient recognition app designed to provide users with valuable insights into skincare products and predict their suitability based on individual skin profiles. 

## Project Overview
IngredientInsightApp leverages advanced mobile technology, incorporating ML Kit-Text Recognition for ingredient detection and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for predictive analytics. Our goal is to enhance the skincare shopping experience by addressing common challenges faced by consumers.

### Problem Statement
1. **Unreadable Ingredient Lists**: Small fonts on packaging make it difficult for consumers to read ingredient lists.
2. **Unfamiliar Ingredient Names**: Many chemical names are confusing, leading to uncertainty in choosing suitable skincare products.
3. **High Return Rates**: The lack of clarity in selecting the right product results in higher return rates.

### Solutions
1. **Enhanced Readability**: Utilize mobile OCR technology to improve the readability of ingredient lists.
2. **Ingredient Insights**: Provide concise descriptions for each ingredient along with symbol alerts for harmful substances.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Offer predictions on product suitability based on user skin data and ingredient analysis, using an SVM algorithm.
